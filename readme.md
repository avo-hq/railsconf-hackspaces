# Railsconf '25 Avo Hack Space

Thanks for wanting to get involved with open source through project we do at Avo.

As a reminder, Avo started out as an admin panel framework and slowly evolved into a complete toolkit to develop internal tools and operational software for your entire team.

We develop commercial software but our roots are with open-source. We have a bunch of initiatives that we're supporting through [open-source](https://github.com/orgs/avo-hq/repositories), [sponsorships](https://github.com/orgs/avo-hq/sponsoring), [events](https://friendlyrb.com/) and other ways.

### Open Source

Some of our more popular open source projects are [avo](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo), [marksmith](https://github.com/avo-hq/marksmith), [class_variants](https://github.com/avo-hq/class_variants), [stimulus-confetti](https://github.com/avo-hq/stimulus-confetti), [prop_initializer](https://github.com/avo-hq/prop_initializer) and [active_storage-blurhash](https://github.com/avo-hq/active_storage-blurhash).

# Hack Spaces

At Hack Spaces we are pretty open to any ideas you have.
We can do work on specific projects, talk about open source, SaaS, dev-tools, development, or other cool topics you think we are covering.

Some suggestions: Rails engines; asset management; Rails and JS integration; gem deployment tactics; product development; running a dev-tool SaaS; marketing for developers;

We prepared a few hack spaces issues for us to work on.
