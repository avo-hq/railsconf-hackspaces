# Railsconf '25 Avo Hack Space

Thanks for wanting to get involved with open source through project we do at Avo.

As a reminder, Avo started out as an admin panel framework and slowly evolved into a complete toolkit to develop internal tools and operational software for your entire team.

We develop commercial software but our roots are with open-source. We have a bunch of initiatives that we're supporting through [open-source](https://github.com/orgs/avo-hq/repositories), [sponsorships](https://github.com/orgs/avo-hq/sponsoring), [events](https://friendlyrb.com/) and other ways.

### Open Source

Some of our more popular open source projects are https://github.com/avo-hq/marksmith, https://github.com/avo-hq/class_variants, https://github.com/avo-hq/stimulus-confetti, https://github.com/avo-hq/prop_initializer, and https://github.com/avo-hq/active_storage-blurhash

 - [`active_storage-blurhash`](https://github.com/avo-hq/active_storage-blurhash) - A plug-n-play [blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) integration for images stored in ActiveStorage
 - [`class_variants`](https://github.com/avo-hq/class_variants) - Easily configure styles and apply them as classes. Very useful when you're implementing Tailwind CSS components and call them with different states.

 - [`prop_initializer`](https://github.com/avo-hq/prop_initializer) - A flexible tool for defining properties on Ruby classes.
